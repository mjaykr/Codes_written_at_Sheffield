This MATLAB script automates the organization of `.xlsx` files in the current working directory by creating a dedicated folder for each file and moving the file into its corresponding folder. Upon execution, the script identifies all `.xlsx` files in the directory where it is run. For each file, it extracts the filename (excluding the `.xlsx` extension) and creates a folder with the same name. The script then moves the `.xlsx` file into this newly created folder. If any errors occur during folder creation or file movement, the script gracefully handles them by issuing warnings and skipping problematic files. This process ensures that the directory is neatly organized, with each `.xlsx` file stored in its own uniquely named folder, making it easier to manage and locate files.
