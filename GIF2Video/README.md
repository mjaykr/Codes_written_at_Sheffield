# GIF to MP4 Converter

This MATLAB script provides a convenient way to batch convert GIF files to MP4 video format. It's designed to process all GIF files within a specified directory, converting them into MP4 files using MATLAB's `VideoWriter` class.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (Tested with MATLAB R2021a, but should work with other versions that support `VideoWriter`)
- Appropriate permissions to read and write files in the target directory

### Installation

No additional installation is required apart from a standard MATLAB setup.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file into your local machine.
2. Place the script in the same directory as the GIF files you want to convert, or modify the `folderPath` variable in the script to point to your directory of GIF files.
3. Run the script in MATLAB. Converted MP4 files will be saved in the same directory as the original GIF files.

## Features

- Batch processes all GIF files in a specified directory
- Converts GIF files to MP4 format
- Easy to modify for different output formats (e.g., MPG)
